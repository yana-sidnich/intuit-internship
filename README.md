# intuit-internship

Hey, it's me yana :)
thanks for this oppertunity.I got confused and wasted a lot of time trying to set up a mongoDB cluster, connecting it with a MONGO_URI, creating schemas for the mongoDB collections, and its just got me confused even know i did it before.
I hope what i produced is enough. I would really love to get an oppertuity to showcase my skills to you :)

I got really confused with the data modelling. I think we should add theaters data(table,collection, json file) if we want to have control about the number of tickets sold. My time is ticking but the data part of my subbmisions needs to be redesigned.
